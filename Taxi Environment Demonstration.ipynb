    "This is original taxi grid enviroment, which is available as part of the OpenAI gym module. The enviroment models a taxi, which moves within the gridworld enviroment with the goal of picking up a passenger and bringing them to a destination. Our modifications on the enviroment were created with two main goals: first, the original taxi grid enviroment is a single agent enviroment. We were interested with multi-agent reinforcement learning, so we created a variation on the enviroment with multiple taxis. Second, the original taxi grid enviroment is relatively inflexible and it is difficult to test agents' consideration of longer term goals. For example, by adding a fuel constraint modification, we were able to test for whether agents would be able consider the long term fuel constraint in pathing. Here, our goal was to make the enviroment more flexible and dynamic by adding a variation with fuel constraints, the ability to use custom grids, and the ability to have an arbitrary number of passengers."
